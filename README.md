## SUT (System Under Test)

A SUT can be a class or an entire application.

## Test suite

If you group related tests to verify the behavior of a SUT.

## Working with mocks

Mocking in a test aims to isolate part of the code and get rid of the dependencies. So you can acually focus SUT. Also using real dependencies is slow because you need to use the actually dependencies like databases or external services. 
Its complex approach. Instead that using mocks is simple and fast because there is no need to initialize the dependencies.


## Regression(retreat, setback) Testing

Regression testing is a type of software testing that ensures that recent changes (like bug fixes, updates, or new features) haven't introduced new bugs or broken existing functionality. The goal of regression testing is to verify that the software still works as expected after any code changes.
